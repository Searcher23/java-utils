Building
========
To build, you need Apache ANT : http://ant.apache.org/
You will also need ANT-contrib: http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/
Do NOT use the old Makefile.

Do a "ant dist" to build the entire distribution.
This will create a "dist-<ver>" dir with the following jar files:
- libjava-<ver>.jar : 
    Compiled class only.

- libjava-<ver>-all.jar : 
    Compiled classes with all dependencies packaged in one jar.

- libjava-<ver>-test.jar : 
    Compiled test classes with test-specific dependencies.
    This requires "libjava-<ver>-all.jar" to be in the same dir to run.

Do a "ant test" to build and run the tests.

Do a "ant clean" to remove the "dist" and "class" dirs and
the distribution zip file.

=============
Documentation
=============
Do a "ant dist" or "ant doc" to build the documentation. 
Then open dist-<ver>/doc/index.html
